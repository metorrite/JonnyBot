/**
 * The slash commands that stand on their own rather than belonging to one feature, each shown as a card on the dashboard's
 * Hub. {@code slashName} is the command's top-level name in Discord. {@code defaultAccess} is plain-English for who may use
 * it when the server hasn't changed anything, and {@code adminByDefault} is whether that default is "Admins only" (which is
 * enforced here, so a server can widen it) as opposed to a rule the command checks itself.
 * <p>
 * To add a command to the Hub, add it here with at least one {@link CommandTag} and give it a card on the website; the generic settings (on/off, who may use it,
 * where it may be used) then apply to it with no further code.
