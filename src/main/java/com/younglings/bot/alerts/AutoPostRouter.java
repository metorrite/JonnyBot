/**
 * The one switch for the bot's own, unprompted posts. The live bot posts them where each server chose. Any other copy of the bot (a development
 * bot sitting in the real server on a stale copy of the database) would post stale or wrong alerts next to the live bot's correct ones, ping the admin
 * role, and DM real players. So when the bot is not live (and posting has not been turned on deliberately with {@code /dev toggleposting}):
 * <ul>
 *     <li>an alert that is only a message ({@link #route}) goes to the channel named by {@code DEV_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID}, or is only logged when that is
 *     not set, and never pings anybody ({@link #noPings});</li>
 *     <li>anything tied to stored state or a person (a post the bot later edits, a DM) is skipped and logged ({@link #skip});</li>
 *     <li>a background sweep that changes the real server by itself (auto-clean deleting messages, autoroles, timed roles, event roles, event
 *     wrap-up) does not run at all ({@link #skipSweep}, T-187). The live bot runs the same sweeps, so nothing is lost in the server.</li>
 * </ul>
 * What somebody runs on purpose (a command, a button, a dashboard action) never goes through here and replies where it was run. Sites reach this
 * through the static methods so the many posters need no new constructor arguments; with no router built (a unit test) everything passes through.
