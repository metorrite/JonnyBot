/**
 * Keeps a linked player's Discord roles in step with whether their RSN is in the clan: adds a configured
 * "verified" role and removes a configured "unverified" role when a player link is created (called from
 * both the admin-review approval flow and the admin's manual-verify path), and swaps Member for Guest and
 * back when the clan roster changes (called from {@link ClanSyncService} for a name that joined or left).
 * <p>
 * Which "verified" role depends on whether {@code rsn} is a currently-tracked clan member (see
 * {@link ClanMemberRepository#isActiveMember}): {@link GuildSettings#verifiedClanRoleId()} if so, otherwise
 * {@link GuildSettings#verifiedNonClanRoleId()} — the latter is meant for a role something else
 * (e.g. a server join flow) usually already grants, so this only fills it in for a verified member
 * who doesn't have it yet. All three role slots (both verified variants, plus
 * {@link GuildSettings#unverifiedRoleId()}) are independently optional — configured via a role
 * dropdown under {@code /configure}'s Verification section, not typed by name, so there's no name
 * to mistype and nothing to look up by string match. A slot left unset (or pointing at a role no
 * longer in the guild) is simply skipped and logged, never guessed — same "fails closed" philosophy
 * as {@code AdminRoleFilter}.
 * <p>
 * The two roles can legitimately be the <em>same</em> role: with Guest as both the "unverified" and the
 * "not a clan member" role, a verified non-clan player keeps Guest while a clan member trades Guest for
 * Member. So the unverified role is never removed if it is the very role being granted, and both
 * changes are sent to Discord as one update — nobody is ever left holding neither role, even briefly.
