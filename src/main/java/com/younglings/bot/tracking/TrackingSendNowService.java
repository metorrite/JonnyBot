/**
 * What the Tracking panel's "Send Now" buttons do: refresh a section's (or one group's) data right now
 * instead of waiting for its schedule, and post whatever that produces to the group's own channels.
 * <p>
 * Two levels, deliberately different in cost. A <b>section</b> ({@link TrackingGroup#source()}) Send Now
 * is the full refresh — it polls every clan member's RuneMetrics profile (which posts each new
 * activity as its own individual entry, exactly like the scheduled polling does), refreshes the roster,
 * or recomputes points, depending on the section, and then sends that section's report where it has
 * one. A single <b>group</b>'s Send Now (only the three computed reports have one) is the cheap
 * version: no polling, just recompute from what's already stored and send. The Discord Admin Log has
 * neither — its entries are real-time events with nothing to refresh.
 * <p>
 * Every result says what happened and, when something was built but couldn't be delivered, why — see
 * {@link TrackingEventRouter#undeliverableReason}.
