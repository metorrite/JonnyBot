/**
 * Reads RuneMetrics' own raw activity-date string ({@code "23-Sep-2026 23:30"}, see {@link PlayerActivity#date()}).
 * <p>
 * <b>What the string is.</b> It is the wall-clock time of the event in <i>UK local time</i> (Europe/London: GMT in winter, BST in summer), not UTC. It was
 * mistaken for UTC at first, which made everything read one hour late during British Summer Time. The evidence is in our own data: read as UTC, 19% of
 * activities appear to have happened after we first polled them; read as Europe/London, none of 5,553 do, and the closest is 0.4 minutes after the event,
 * so an entry also shows up in the log within about a minute of the event, and the time is when the event happened, not when it was logged.
 * <p>
 * Whether the zone is really "UK local time" or a fixed UTC+1 can't be told from summer data alone (they are the same until the clocks go back on
 * 2026-10-25); {@code RuneMetricsClockCheck} watches for the difference, and the zone can be overridden with the {@code RUNEMETRICS_TIME_ZONE}
 * environment variable without a code change.
