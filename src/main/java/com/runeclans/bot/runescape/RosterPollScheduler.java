/**
 * Keeps every tracked player's data (and the tracking feed it drives) fresh by registering the recurring poll jobs
 * with the {@link PollCoordinator}; see {@link ClanSyncScheduler} for the separate, once-a-day concern of keeping each
 * clan's roster itself (who's a member at all) up to date.
 * <p>
 * A player belongs to JonnyBot, not to a server, so there is one polling list for all of them and each name is
 * polled once per cycle however many servers it is in. The list has three tiers, each a job with its own window:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Clan players</b> — everyone currently in the clan of a server that has registered one, linked or not
 *       (rosters are read from every such server and merged, so a clan tracked by two servers is polled once).
 *       They are the reason for the tracking feeds, so they are refreshed often: every
 *       {@link BotConfig#getRunescapeClanPollWindowMinutes()} minutes. A poll's new activity is announced in
 *       every server whose clan the player is in (see {@link RuneScapeStatsService}). With the hub's polling list on, RuneLink-linked
 *       characters the hub places in a clan registered on RuneClans join this tier too, whether or not any of the bot's servers has
 *       that clan (T-736).</li>
 *   <li><b>Community players</b> (T-736) — linked characters the hub's polling list places in a community and in no registered clan.
 *       Tracked fully like the rest, every {@link BotConfig#getRunescapeCommunityPollWindowMinutes()} minutes (the linked window
 *       unless set). Empty while the hub's list is off.</li>
 *   <li><b>Everyone else who linked</b> — registered with JonnyBot ({@code /rsn}) or linked with RuneLink (the hub's polling list,
 *       T-736), and in no registered clan or community. Their profile and
 *       history only need to stay roughly current, so they are spread across
 *       {@link BotConfig#getRunescapeLinkedPollWindowMinutes()} minutes, anchored so a cycle's last poll lands right
 *       before {@link #LINKED_ANCHOR_UTC} UTC, 30 minutes ahead of RuneScape's own daily reset — that keeps the day's
 *       numbers as current as reasonably possible without cutting it too close.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Players nobody has linked and no registered clan lists are not polled at all. Every name is in one tier only ({@link #tiers}), and the
 * engine merges a name already queued at another tier, so nobody is polled twice in a short window (Drake's rule, plan C-8 Q-6).
 * <p>
 * Each run works out its list afresh, so a server that registers a clan, or a player who links, joins the next run
 * without a restart. Each job spreads its players evenly across its window; the coordinator then paces them against
 * everything else the bot is polling, and skips anyone who was polled by something else within the last half window.
 * This class no longer sleeps between polls or owns a thread: it only says who to poll, how often and how urgently.
