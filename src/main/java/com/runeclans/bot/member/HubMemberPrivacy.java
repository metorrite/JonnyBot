/**
 * Member privacy in the RuneClans hub (T-750, runeclans-hub docs/MEMBER-PRIVACY.md). With the switch on (RuneClan Admin > Switches "Member
 * privacy in the API", or {@code RUNECLANS_HUB_MEMBER_PRIVACY=on}, which wins while set; T-817) and the hub client on, every member privacy change the bot saves (a member's own toggles, Site Admin > Member privacy) is also sent to the hub, so the
 * hub's XP rankings and member pages hide the same people. The bot is the one place these are edited (the website saves them through the
 * bot), so its tables stay the ones it reads and the hub gets each change after it. What the hub had before the switch came on is moved
 * with the hub's move tool ({@code member-privacy}). Off, nothing is sent.
 * <p>
 * Sends run on their own lane, never in the website's request. Each hub row (one path) keeps only its newest body until the hub takes it,
 * so a save held while the hub is down can never land after a newer one: a held "show" is replaced by the "hide" that follows it. A send
 * the hub can't take now is tried again every {@value #RETRY_SECONDS} seconds; one it refuses is dropped. What is still held when the bot
 * stops is lost: the hub catches up on the member's next save or the next {@code MoveTool copy member-privacy}.
 * <p>
 * Each bot process sends what it saved on its own lane, so the newest-wins rule holds within one process. Two processes saving the same
 * row at nearly the same moment can reach the hub in either order; the member's next save puts it right.
