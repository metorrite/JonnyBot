/**
 * The Discord job outbox (T-456): website changes that end in a Discord request are saved as a {@link DiscordJob} and answered at once; this
 * runs them in the background on its own {@link BotScheduler#lane}, one at a time, oldest first. A rate limit puts the job back as
 * "retrying" until Discord allows it (never an error); a fault that may pass is tried again with growing waits; Discord's plain "no" ends it
 * as failed with the reason in words. The website polls {@code /internal/discord-jobs} for the state.
 *
 * <p>Several bot processes can drain the same table (T-696, docs/SCALING-STATE.md M3, M4): each claims jobs under its own {@link ProcessId},
 * only for servers on the shards it runs, and refreshes its claims every {@link #HEARTBEAT} on a lane of their own (so a slow job never lets
 * them lapse). A job whose claim has not been refreshed for {@link #CLAIM_EXPIRY} belonged to a process that is gone; any process puts it
 * back or ends it, as a restart did before. With one process this is the same outbox as before, except that a job cut off by a restart is
 * picked up within {@link #CLAIM_EXPIRY} instead of at once (a new process can't tell a restart from a second copy starting).
