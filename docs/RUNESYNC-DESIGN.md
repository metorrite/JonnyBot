# RuneSync: the RS3 clan plugin (design)

Ticket T-002. Status: **draft with defaults** (Drake away, 2026-10-20: "build everything ... except where you absolutely need my input"). Every open choice has a default in section 13; nothing here blocks on Drake except the items in section 14.

Read with: `docs/LINK-SYSTEM.md` (RuneLink, T-112) and `docs/ECOSYSTEM.md`.

## 0. In one paragraph

RuneSync is a Lua plugin in each member's own RS3 client. It reports **only the local player's own** XP, loot, boss kills and clue completions to RuneClan Bot's existing plugin ingest API, and only the categories that member has switched on (everything starts off). It does not pair by itself: it depends on **RuneLink** (T-116), asks it for a short-lived signed assertion, and sends that with every batch, so RuneClan Bot knows which Discord member the data belongs to without RuneSync ever holding a secret of its own. The data feeds what already exists (event objectives through `PluginEventFeed`, the points ledger, the member profile) and every setting lives on the website first: the member's profile for personal consent and data, the dashboard for clan settings.

## 1. Hard limits (not design choices)

- **Own data only.** Jagex's rule: nothing about other players leaves the client. No roster scans, no "who is nearby", no other players' names in any payload. Clan-wide views are built server-side from many members each reporting themselves.
- **No automation.** No actions for the player, no menu entries that send actions, no unhidden interfaces, no PvP info.
- **HTTP only to the manifest base URLs.** No redirects or shorteners. The base URL is moderated, so it must be final before the first submission (section 11).
- **Code Drake can review line by line.** Readable, commented, no obfuscation; numbers-and-dots versions.
- **The game must be open.** Gaps and resends are normal; the ingest is idempotent per event id (already built).
- **No clan data API today** (VarClan etc. unavailable), so RuneSync cannot read clan rank or clan chat membership; the server decides clan membership from the roster as today.

## 2. What already exists (reuse, don't rebuild)

| Piece | Where | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest API, schema v1, per-event rejects, 100-event batches, 14-day max age | `plugin/PluginPayload.java`, `internal/PluginApi.java` (`/internal/plugin/ingest`, `whoami`, `me`) | every RuneSync upload |
| Consent per category, enforced on the server | `plugin/PluginCategory.java`, `PluginRepository` (`plugin_consent`) | gate on what is stored |
| Idempotent store, retention 180 days | `PluginRepository`, `PluginRetention` | raw events |
| Event sinks | `PluginEventSink` -> `events/PluginEventFeed` + `PluginObjectiveMatcher` | bingo/scavenger/boss-night auto ticks |
| Points ledger | `points/*` | per-clan point rules (T-061) |
| Member profile Plugin tab | website `src/app/profile` (`PluginPanel`, `pluginActions.ts`) | tokens, consent, delete my data |
| Dashboard coverage page | website `src/app/dashboard/[guildId]/plugin` | clan counts only |
| Website proxy for plugin calls | website `src/lib/pluginProxy.ts` on the `api.` host | public face of the ingest |
| GE prices | T-104 (RS3 lookup: GE prices) | valuing drops server-side |

## 3. Identity: RuneLink, not a RuneSync token

- RuneSync declares RuneLink as a **required dependency** (T-117). With no link, RuneSync shows "Link your account with RuneLink first" and a button that calls `RuneLink:OpenLinkPanel()`; it sends nothing.
- Before each upload RuneSync calls `RuneLink:GetAssertion("RuneSync", cb)` (signed, 15 minutes, LINK-SYSTEM section 13.2) and caches it until 2 minutes before expiry.
- Upload header: `Authorization: RuneLink <assertion>` (the older `RSLink` scheme is still accepted). The ingest verifies the signature with the link key set, then asks the link service through its **internal route** (never its classes, LINK-SYSTEM section 2) who the first-party consumer RuneClan Bot should credit: `POST /internal/rsnlink/resolve` -> `{ discordId, rsn, verification }`. This route exists only for first-party consumers on the internal port; other plugins keep seeing an alias only.
- The RSN in the batch must equal the link's RSN (after `normaliseRsn`), otherwise the batch is refused like today's "not your name" case.
- **Manual tokens stay** (`X-Plugin-Token`, profile "Create token") for the simulator (`tools/plugin_simulator.py`) and for players who do not want RuneLink. Default: the profile hides token creation behind an "Advanced" disclosure once RuneLink is live.
- A RuneLink link counts as "this Discord owns this RSN" for ingest only. Whether it also creates or verifies a RuneClan Bot `player_link` is T-121's call (clan adoption), not this design's.

## 4. What RuneSync reports (first data, per the ticket)

All events use schema v1 (`PluginPayload`). New types are additive: an old server rejects an unknown type per event, never the batch.

| Data | Category (consent) | Event type | Client source (own player only) | Payload `data` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Skill XP | **XP (new)** "Skill XP" | `XP` (new) | `SkillTransmit` | `{ skill, xp, level }` (totals, not deltas) | Sent at most once per skill per 60 s batch window (latest value wins). Server stores the client's raw value and divides by `PLUGIN_XP_SCALE` (default 10, see 13.D4). |
| Loot | DROPS | `DROP` | `ObjStack` added with `isOwner` (own ground loot); loot-window items via inventory change while the loot interface is open | `{ itemId, itemName, quantity }` | Source = NPC that died within 3 ticks on the stack's tile or adjacent, else `OTHER`. No `value` from the client: the server prices with T-104 GE prices. |
| Boss kill | KILLS | `KILL` | Game message "Your <boss> kill count is: N." (chatAccess, game messages only) | `{ bossName, killCount }` | Message-based so attribution is certain; NPC death events alone are not trusted (attribution to "me" is untested). |
| Clue completion | ACHIEVEMENTS | `CLUE` (new) | Game message on casket opening "You have completed N <tier> Treasure Trails." | `{ tier, count }` | Casket loot then arrives as DROP with source `{kind: ACTIVITY, name: "<tier> clue"}`. |
| Presence | PRESENCE | `PRESENCE` | login / logout | `{ state }` | **Not sent in v1** (default off and no feature uses it yet). |
| Level-up, quest, collection log | ACHIEVEMENTS | existing types | later | | T-061 maps them to objectives/points; RuneSync sends them in a later version. |

**Chat use is narrow.** RuneSync asks for `chatAccess` only to read the player's own **game/engine** messages above. It never sends chat text, never reads clan, friends or public chat types, and only the extracted fields (`bossName`, `killCount`, `tier`, `count`) leave the client. If a member refuses chatAccess, kills and clues simply do not report; XP and loot still work.

**Event ids:** `rs1:<trackingIdHash8 or "anon">:<unixMillis>:<counter>`, unique per client, 8-64 chars as the ingest requires. `trackingAccess` is optional; it only makes ids stable across reinstalls.

## 5. Sending

- Queue in memory; every 60 s (from the `ServerLogic` subscription, never from a callback chain) send up to 100 events.
- On failure: keep the batch, back off 1, 2, 5, 10 minutes; on `401`/`403` stop sending and show "Relink RuneLink" in the panel.
- Persist the unsent queue in `PersistentDB` on `PluginShutdown()` (cap 500 events, oldest dropped first) so a restart does not lose a kill.
- The server's per-event `rejected` reasons are kept for the diagnostics panel (last 20 batches).
- No send when the member has switched every category off (the client asks `GET /v1/runesync/config` on login, then every 10 minutes).

## 6. Consent and settings (website first)

| Setting | Where it is changed | Where it is shown | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Categories (XP, Drops, Boss kills, Achievements incl. clues, Presence) | **Website profile -> Plugin tab** (primary) and the RuneSync settings panel in game (mirror; writes the same server record) | both | all **off** |
| Delete everything RuneSync sent | profile Plugin tab (exists) | | |
| Pause sending | game panel only (a local switch; no server data) | game panel | off (not paused) |
| In-game clan panel | game panel | game panel | **off** |
| Clan: which plugin events feed events and points | **Dashboard -> Clan plugin** page (T-061 owns the rules) | dashboard | off per type until staff turn it on |
| Clan: coverage counts | dashboard Clan plugin page (exists, counts only, nobody named) | dashboard | on (it is counts) |

The server is the source of truth for consent (`plugin_consent`); the plugin only reads it to avoid collecting what would be refused anyway. New categories `XP` needs a migration-free enum addition (consent rows are text) and a label on the profile.

## 7. Server additions (bot)

- `POST /internal/plugin/ingest` accepts `Authorization: RuneLink <assertion>` (or the older `RSLink`) beside `X-Plugin-Token` (T-200).
- `PluginCategory.XP`, `PluginEventType.XP` and `CLUE` with validation; XP scale; DROP valuation from GE prices at store time (stored as `valueGp` in the event's data copy, nullable when unknown) (T-201).
- `GET /internal/plugin/runesync/config` -> `{ consent: [...], panelAvailable: bool, minClientVersion: "0.1.0", sendEverySeconds: 60 }` and `POST` (or `PUT`) `.../consent` (same rules as the profile action; the game client can only send GET and POST) (T-202).
- `POST /internal/plugin/runesync/diagnostics` -> stores a redacted snapshot for 14 days, returns a short id like the bot's dev snapshot (T-093) (T-202).
  - Built (T-202): `minClientVersion` comes from `RUNESYNC_MIN_CLIENT_VERSION` (unset = `0.0.0`, nobody refused). The config call may add `?client=<name version>&paused=true|false`, which only feeds the profile's device card. Snapshots: 16 KB max, 10 per member per day, fields named like token, assertion, tracking id, chat text/message, secret, password, authorization, cookie or discord dropped at any depth (permission flags like `chatAccess` stay). Owner view: `GET /internal/admin/runesync/diagnostics/{id}` (RuneClan Admin at runeclans.com/admin -> RuneSync diagnostics). Member view: `GET /internal/plugin/me/runesync`.
- `GET /internal/plugin/runesync/panel` -> the member's own clan's upcoming and running events, their own points and their own event progress (T-206). Data flows **into** the client only; this does not break the own-data rule.
  - Built (T-206): one entry per server the member shares with RuneClan Bot whose **Clan plugin** page has "Allow the in-game clan panel" on (`plugin_guild_settings.clan_panel`, default off; admin route `GET/PUT plugin-settings`). Events: SIGNUPS and RUNNING, 10 per clan, with `joined`. Points: the member's own balance when the clan uses points. Progress: for running events the member is in, their (or their team's) points, objectives done of total, bingo tiles done. Cached 60 s per member; `panelAvailable` in the config is true when at least one clan allows it.
  - Added (T-142, T-143; PLUGIN-ERA-FEATURES.md sections 2 and 3, Drake's Q2/Q3 defaults): a bingo carries its board, `bingo.board = { size, cells: [{ label, done, locked }] }` in a solo event and `bingo.teamBoard` (same shape) in a team event, where the team's board is the one played. A team event carries `teamStatus = { name, members: [{ name, inGame }] }`: the member's own team only, names as the server shows them, and `inGame` (a RuneSync check-in in the last 11 minutes) only for teammates who switched on the **Presence** category; `null` for the rest ("not shared"). No location, combat stats or gear. RuneSync 0.0.8 draws both (tap-to-read tile grid, team lines).
- All behind the website proxy on the `api.` host, which keeps its own per-IP limits.

## 8. Website views (every data type has one)

| Data / control | View |
|---|---|
| XP reported | profile Plugin tab: "Last XP sync" per skill (time + value); clan site profile already shows XP from RuneMetrics, plugin XP is used for event/competition tracking only in v1 |
| Drops | profile Plugin tab: last 50 own drops (item, source, value, time); clan drops page keeps its RuneMetrics feed, plugin drops are added there only when T-061 says so |
| Kills, clues | profile Plugin tab: last 50 |
| Device / client | profile Plugin tab: client version, last seen, last batch result, "Paused" flag |
| Diagnostics id | profile Plugin tab shows ids the member created; the owner can open any id (redacted) in RuneClan Admin |
| Clan settings | dashboard Clan plugin page (T-061 adds the rules section) |

## 9. In-game UI

- **RuneSync panel** (settings icon, `hasSettingsIcon`): link status (from RuneLink), category toggles (mirror), pause, "Copy diagnostics id", "Open website settings" (shows the URL; the client cannot open a browser).
- **Clan panel** (opt-in, off): upcoming events with start times in local time, own points, own progress in a running bingo. Read-only. Built with plain components first; PrettyUI only if Drake approves the dependency (13.D9).
- No overhead titles, party window or "has plugin" markers in v1 (T-062, later).

## 10. Dev snapshot (bug reports)

"Copy diagnostics id" posts `{ clientVersion, rsLinkApiVersion, settings, queueLength, last20Batches: [{at, accepted, duplicates, rejected:[reason...]}], permissions: {http, chat, tracking} }` to the diagnostics route and shows the id (and prints it to the console). Never included: assertion, RuneLink token, tracking id, chat text. The board's bug form already has a "dev snapshot id" field; this id goes there.

## 11. Install, update, manifest

- `plugin.json`: name `RuneSync`, version `0.1.0` for the first submission, `requiredDependencies: { "RuneLink": "RuneLink" }`, `optionalPermissions: ["httpAccess", "chatAccess", "trackingAccess"]` (http is required in practice; the panel explains each), `urls: { "jonnybot": "<API_BASE>" }`, `hasSettingsIcon: true`, contact email from 13.D6.
- Install from mod.io. Updates through mod.io; each release passes Jagex moderation. The server sends `minClientVersion`; an older client shows "Update RuneSync" and stops sending (never breaks the game).
- `<API_BASE>` today is `https://api.rsyounglings.com`. If T-063 moves the API to a neutral domain, it must happen **before** the first RuneSync submission (same rule as RuneLink). Default: RuneSync keeps the RuneClan Bot API host; it is RuneClan Bot's plugin, so the neutral-domain requirement applies to RuneLink, not RuneSync.

## 12. Privacy notice (draft for the submission, to publish at `/runesync/privacy` on the RuneClan Bot site)

> **RuneSync privacy notice (draft)**
> RuneSync is a free plugin that sends some of **your own** RuneScape activity to RuneClan Bot, a Discord bot your clan uses, so your clan's events and points can count it automatically.
> **What is sent, only if you switch it on:** your skill XP totals; items you receive and the monster or activity they came from; your boss kill counts; your clue scroll completions. With each upload: your RuneScape name and a signed proof from the RuneLink plugin that this name is linked to your Discord account. Nothing about other players is ever sent. Chat text is never sent.
> **What is not sent:** passwords, chat, other players, your location, your bank.
> **Where it goes:** RuneClan Bot's servers, hosted by Railway in the United States (US West). The United States is not a UK-adequate country; your data is protected by encrypted connections (HTTPS), access limited to the bot's operator, and automatic deletion.
> **How long:** raw reports are deleted after 180 days. Points and event results that came from them stay with the clan's event history.
> **Your rights:** see and delete everything RuneSync sent on your RuneClan Bot profile (Plugin tab), switch any category off at any time, or remove the plugin. Contact: <contact email, 13.D6>.

The Jagex submission form answers (permissions, Case 3 details) are filled from this notice in T-205; Drake submits.

## 13. Decisions made for Drake

| # | Question | Default chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | How does RuneSync prove who the player is? | RuneLink signed assertion on each batch; manual tokens kept for the simulator and opt-outs | No secret in public plugin code; one link for every plugin |
| D2 | First data | XP totals, own loot, boss kill counts, clue completions (ticket default) | Feeds bingo, boss nights and XP competitions straight away |
| D3 | Kill attribution | Only the game's "kill count is" message, not NPC death events | Certain attribution; NPC deaths near you might be someone else's |
| D4 | XP scale | Server divides the client's value by `PLUGIN_XP_SCALE`, default 10; Drake confirms in the beta | Observed Fletching 105,735,700 at level 110 |
| D5 | Drop values | Priced on the server from T-104 GE prices | No GPL dependency in the plugin, one price source |
| D6 | Contact email | A new address Drake creates (not the mod.io login); placeholder until then | Jagex requires a public one |
| D7 | Hosting / data protection | Stay on Railway US West and use Jagex Case 3 (extra form) | No move needed now; moving ingest to EU later makes it Case 2 |
| D8 | chatAccess | Asked for, optional; game messages only, fields only | Needed for kill counts and clues; refusing it only loses those |
| D9 | UI library | Plain components; PrettyUI only with Drake's ok | Fewer dependencies to review |
| D10 | In-game clan panel | Built, **off** by default | Optional-off rule |
| D11 | Presence | Category stays, not sent in v1 | No feature uses it yet |
| D12 | Batch timing | Every 60 s, 100 events max, queue 500 persisted on shutdown | Cheap on the server; little loss on crash |
| D13 | Retention | Keep the existing 180 days | Already built and documented |
| D14 | Base URL | Keep `api.rsyounglings.com` for RuneSync; RuneLink alone gets the neutral domain | RuneSync is RuneClan Bot's plugin |
| D15 | Version for first submission | 0.1.0 | Numbers and dots only |

## 14. Drake's actions (cannot be done for him)

1. Test every RuneSync build in the beta client (`prf`, `pon`, `prl runesync`) and review every Lua line before submission.
2. Confirm the XP scale (D4) by comparing a skill's XP in game with the value logged.
3. Create the public contact email (D6).
4. Submit on mod.io, accept the EULA, fill the Case 3 form (D7).
5. Approve PrettyUI if wanted (D9).

## 15. Build tickets

| Ticket | Repo | What | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-200 | bot | Ingest accepts RuneLink assertions | T-113 |
| T-201 | bot + website | XP and CLUE types, XP category, server-side drop pricing, profile labels | none |
| T-202 | bot + website | RuneSync config/consent/diagnostics routes + profile Plugin tab additions | T-201 |
| T-203 | RuneSync | Collectors, queue and sending | T-117, T-201, T-200 |
| T-204 | RuneSync | Settings panel + diagnostics button | T-203, T-202 |
| T-205 | website + RuneSync docs | Privacy notice page + submission pack | T-201 |
| T-206 | bot + website | In-game panel feed route (off by default) | T-202 |
| T-207 | RuneSync | In-game clan panel (off by default) | T-204, T-206 |

T-061 (more types + per-clan points rules) and T-062 (plugin-era features) were blocked on this design; they can now follow T-201.
